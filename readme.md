### run code yourself

to run some of these demos yourself, you'll need [node.js and
npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

once you have node.js & npm installed, fork this repository.

go to your forked version on github and via command line `git clone` the repository.

on your computer navigate to the directory that the repo was cloned into.

once there, do `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

once you've installed, you will have access to a number of scripts you can run
from the command line:

``

### understanding the code

the demo reel is made up of 11 different demo programs (the various .js files)
that get put one after the other into a single html file. that html file will
include all the assets (images) used in the demos. it will also include
javascript that allows you to switch between demos by hitting certain keys on
the keyboard (as noted above).







### build your own version of the demo reel








all demos were created with [regl](http://regl.party).

the entire demo reel can be packed into a single (large, ~12mb in this case) html file that runs in most browsers. it also works offline. 

see more of my [regl experiments](https://github.com/mk30/reglexperiments) and some of my [other programming projects](http://kukso.space/programming.html).
